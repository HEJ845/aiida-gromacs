Scripting with the Plugin
=========================

Before attempting to use the features here, you need to have completed the steps in :doc:`installation` and started the verdi daemon as described in :doc:`aiida_sessions`.

Using our plugin, it is possible to build powerful scripted workflows whilst capturing the provenance of data for each GROMACS step. The following documentation will show you how to use this plugin with a scripted interface so you can build it into your tools.
