    "\n",
    "###Â Why not just use a script to keep a record of simulation steps?\n",

    "### How can we track complex simulation protocols in a FAIR way?\n",

    "The provenance of each command will be recorded in realtime and the files inputted and outputted for each command is saved in the aiida database\n"
